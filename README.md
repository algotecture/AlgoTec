It allows owners to quickly and easily enter information such as the address, property type, ownership type, and any improvements made to the property. The form also allows owners to provide details about the relevant information. Once the form is completed and submitted, the owner can save the form and use it as a reference point in the future through the Algotecture Interfaces. 

The form is a great way for owners to keep their information organized and easily accessible.
